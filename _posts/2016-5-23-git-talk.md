## Outline

* **Introduction**
    - Git vs. GitHub
        + Git is a command line tool written by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds.
        + GitHub is a website implemented in ruby-on-rails which allows users to store their git repositories on the internet and provides additional tools for managing permissions and reviewing contributions to the repository.
        + Over time, they have become increasingly synonymous, but it is important to understand that GitHub could be swapped out for BitBucket, GitLab, or any other server hosting a git repositiory. Git is entirely decoupled from any online services and has a standard interface for hooking up what are referred to as 'remote repositories'

## Introduction

Git has a reputation of being difficult to grok on first pass. While this reputation is not totally undeserved, a good tutorial can make all the difference. This post aims to teach the reader the basic workflow for contributing to a project on GitHub. With this goal in mind, we shall begin with a few words on the difference between git and GitHub. Hopefully this will give us a bit more context for the concepts introduced later on. If not--well, a little history never hurt anyone!

Git is a command line tool written by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds. GitHub is a website implemented in ruby-on-rails which allows users to store their git repositories on the internet and provides additional tools for managing permissions and reviewing contributions to the repository. Over time, they have become increasingly synonymous, but it is important to understand that GitHub could be swapped out for BitBucket, GitLab, or any other server hosting a git repositiory. Git is entirely decoupled from any online services and has a standard interface for hooking up what are referred to as 'remote repositories'

## Philosophy

- Philosophy
    + Underlying Structure (and how this influences the types of commands)
    + working directory / staging area / repository / remote

As with most great tools used by software engineers for decades at a time, git was written by a Linux kernel hacker over the course of a few long weekends in April, 2005. As with many tools sharing this type of lineage, there are two things you can be sure of:

1. Git is beautifully designed, with everything you could want out of a version control system (vcs).
2. Git is incredibly non-user friendly, requiring a deep understanding of the underlying data structure to make full use of the tool.

The good news is that basic usage of git is actually pretty simple, and understanding git as a data structure can be done by drawing it out--just like all the other data structures you've learned. When in doubt, draw it out!

### Underlying Structure

Understanding git is much easier once you know how it's implemented. However, I've deliberately chosen to ignore certain concepts for the sake of simplicity. My hope is that by the end of this section you'll understand enough to learn from the manual without getting confused.

The fundamental objects in git are commits, and pointers to commits. If you remember your EECS280 lectures on linked lists, you're gonna do fine here because git can be thought of as a singly linked list. Nodes in the graph are commit objects, each with a unique identifier in the form of a SHA-1 hash.
