The Michigan Data Science Team is excited to have partnered with Google and University of Michigan-Flint to engineer a data platform and accompanying app in our continued efforts to help the community of Flint using our data analytics skillset. This app will provide users with information regarding key public services like water bottle distribution centers and the ability to request new water testing kits. Users will also be able to report concerns about the water at their location, and even access our predictive model to warn users at potentially high risk locations.

Google.org is providing the University of Michigan-Flint $150,000 to built the platform and the app, as well as providing access to google engineering consultants who will aid in producing visualizations using the Google Maps API and oversee the user interface design of the app. MDST has created a multidisciplinary engineering team team to oversee and manage the creation of our predictive model and data platform.

We will continue our efforts to ask and answer the data related questions surrounding the crisis in order to provide as much value as we can to the people of Flint. We are incredibly grateful for the support from Google and for the chance to collaborate with our friends and fellow researchers at the University of Michigan-Flint campus.
