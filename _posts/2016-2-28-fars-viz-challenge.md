Last week, we held the FARS Dataset Visualization Challenge, where teams were tasked with visualizing more than a decade of fatal traffic accident records to address the question - "What causes drunk driving accidents?" 


First prize went to __Team Bidiu (Chengyu Dai, Cyrus Anderson, Cupjin Huang, and Wenbo Shen)__ whose presentation addressed the questions: __who__ is driving drunk, __where__ are they driving, and __when__ do fatal accidents occur? For their first-place finish, each member of Team Bidiu will receive a $25 gift card to Amazon.com! You can view Team Bidiu's presentation and source code at the team's Github page.
