It’s my great pleasure to be announcing the next MDST competition! We are very fortunate to be partnering with the Michigan Institute for Data Science (or 'MIDAS') for this event. We will be holding the kickoff meeting this Thursday at 5:00pm in 3150 DOW. Through this partnership, we’ve been able to obtain a particularly interesting dataset. We have compiled records of every fatal car accident reported in the United States between 2003 and 2014, a dataset known as the Fatal Accident Reporting System Dataset, or FARS. The challenge will be to predict whether or not a drunk driver was involved in the accident. 

More information about logistics, prizes, and the dataset itself will be given at the kickoff ceremony this Thursday. Additionally, we will be awarding prizes to the winners of our last competition, the RateMyProfessor challenge, so if you won a prize, please show up to claim it.

If you have any further questions, feel free to email me at mdst-coms@umich.edu
