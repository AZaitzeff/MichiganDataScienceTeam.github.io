MDST will be participating in its first ever online data science competition, the Springleaf Marketing Response Challenge, during the first few weeks of the Fall semester. In this challenge, competitors are tasked with preemptively identifying customers who will respond to a direct mail offer for a personal or auto loan. For privacy reasons, features are completely anonymized, encouraging competitors to employ creative data-driven feature selection methods.

Deadline: Monday, 19 October 2015
