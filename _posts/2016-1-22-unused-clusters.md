ARC-TS was kind enough to let MDST pick up the unused cores on their computing cluster, which are usually used for computationally intensive research simulations and big data algorithms. You can read more about it at [this link](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/2016/01/20/new-arc-ts-program-offers-unused-cycles-on-flux-to-undergraduates-at-no-cost/)!

_edit: The link has since been depricated. ARC-TS updated their website and did't repost the old articles._
