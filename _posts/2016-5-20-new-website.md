If you are reading this, then congratulations! You've found the new online home of the Michigan Data Science Team! We decided to make the move from Squarespace because it didn't give us enough control over the content on the website. Members of MDST have created some pretty cool visualizations and notebooks for some of the competitions, and by owning the codebase of the website we can better showcase this work.

There's still a lot of work to do in the move, but now that we host via GitHub Pages, we can keep track of the things left to do through the [issues](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/MichiganDataScienceTeam.github.io/issues) system. If you find the good nature in your soul to help us out, it'd be much appreciated.
