## Notes

### Outline

* History of the problem.
    * The switch from Detroit water to the backup system in Flint.
    * The VT Study
* Our efforts
    * The two reports.
    * What our reports tell us.
* Challenging Conventional Wisdom.
    * Lead service lines alone don't account for the whole story.
* Partnership with Flint Action
    * Their plan to collect data from residents
* Conclusion
    * 'The common wisdom in Lancing right now--that government owned lead service lines account for a majority of the lead--is at the very least questionable and at worst completely incorrect. If our suspicions are correct, then the City of Flint may be committing to a costly non-solution to Flint's water woes.


### Findings of Note

#### Data Dive Results
* Elevated lead levels are less than 9% of samples.
* Property age is highly correllated to high lead levels.
    * We see a spike in lead levels for homes which were built around 1950.
* The material of the service line is not as predictive as the common narrative suggests.
*
